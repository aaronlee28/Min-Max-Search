# Min-Max-Search

The goal of this project is to find the minimum and maximum value in a list. If there is only one item found on the list, then the minimum and maximum is itself. If there are more than two items on the list, then the input will be split into two halves, and divided as evenly as possible, and the minimum and maximum of each half will be found recursively. 

This project highlights the use of binary search and recursion.
